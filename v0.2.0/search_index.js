The first tuple contains the elevation correction for site 1 and 2. The second tuple returns the parallactic angle correction for site 1 and 2\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Pyehtim.get_scantable-Tuple{Any}","page":"Home","title":"Pyehtim.get_scantable","text":"get_scantable(obs)\n\nConstructs the scan table of a given observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Pyehtim.load_uvfits_and_array","page":"Home","title":"Pyehtim.load_uvfits_and_array","text":"load_uvfits_and_array(uvfile, arrayfile=nothing; kwargs...)\n\nLoad a uvfits file with eht-imaging and returns a eht-imaging Obsdata object. You can optionally pass an array file as well that will load additional information such at the telescopes field rotation information with the arrayfile. This is expected to be an eht-imaging produced array or antenna file.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Pyehtim.scan_average-Tuple{Any}","page":"Home","title":"Pyehtim.scan_average","text":"scan_average(obs)\n\nThis homogenizes the scan times for an eht-imaging Obsdata object. This is needed because eht-imaging has a bug that will sometimes create very small scans and this can mess up both the closure construction and the gain scan times. Note that this is only a problem if we are fitting scan averaged data.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
